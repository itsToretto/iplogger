# IP Logger 

## Introduction
What it does is basically, every time someone connects to the server, when he disconnects, even if he doesn't register, it saves: The username, the IP, the date and exact time he connected, and disconnected. So four fields. How can this be useful? Well, an example is: You can detect multi-accounts. (manually ofc, I can release an automated one if requested.)
